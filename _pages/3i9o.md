## Overview

The 3i/9o is a multiple for VCV Rack that clones signals.  

It features three sets of inputs with normalled connections, allowing for flexible chaining based on your patch.  

You can configure it for 1 input to 9 outputs, 1 input to 6 outputs and 1 input to 3 outputs, or 3 sets of 1 input to 3 outputs. 

An LED indicates the signal polarity at the set's outputs: red for negative, blue for positive.  

Even though it's possible to stack cables in VCV Rack, this module helps with organization and visualization of duplicated signals.

## Features

- 3 sets of 1 input to 3 outputs
- Inputs 2 and 3 normalled to preceding outputs
- 1 input to 9 outputs, 1 input to 6 outputs and 1 input to 3 outputs, or 3 inputs to 3 outputs
- LED color based on the signal at the set of outputs
- Red for negative, blue for positive
