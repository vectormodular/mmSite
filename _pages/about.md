**Vector Modular** was founded by Steve Brenner, a dedicated musician and developer with a lifelong passion for electronic instruments. Steve’s musical journey began in childhood, evolving from toy keyboards to software like FruityLoops and GarageBand, and ultimately to analog synthesis with his first hardware synthesizer, the Roland JX-8P. His exploration continued as he became an active member of the online music community at <a href="https://gearspace.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-and-electronic-music-production/" target="_blank">gearspace.com</a>. 

A pivotal moment arrived when Steve explored DIY projects, beginning with Bleep Labs kits and quickly progressing to the Mutable Instruments Shruthi-1.This experience ignited a profound appreciation for the innovative approaches of Mutable Instruments. Since diving into Eurorack hardware in 2015, Steve has embraced modular synthesis as his primary approach to creating electronic sounds. He currently releases music under the artist name <a href="https://voct.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Voct</a>.

Inspired by an exciting idea for a new module, Steve set out to bring it to life. However, he soon realized he didn’t know where to begin. Driven by this idea, as well as a recently renewed interest in coding and development, he began to envision a unique suite of modules that would not only fulfill specific roles within a modular system, but also serve as valuable learning opportunities. Thus, Vector Modular was born—a project that combines technical precision with dynamic creativity. 

The name "Vector Modular" reflects Steve's enthusiasm for vector synthesis and XY control methods. He believes that synthesis can be both technical and expressive. Vector Modular's goal is to develop high-quality, innovative modules that add to the modular community and, ultimately, bring these concepts to life in hardware form. 

Vector Modular is committed to pushing the boundaries of modular synthesis by inspiring musicians to explore new possibilities as they manipulate sound waves.
