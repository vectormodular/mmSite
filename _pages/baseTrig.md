## Overview

The baseTrig is a powerful clock and trigger generator for VCV Rack, designed to enhance your rhythmic creativity.

With an internal clock generator and the ability to sync to external clock signals, baseTrig offers flexible tempo control for any setup.

Featuring 14 distinct rhythmic interval outputs—including standard notes, triplets, and offbeat options—baseTrig allows you to create intricate patterns that drive drum modules and sequencers

Its intuitive controls, including tap tempo and tempo modulation via CV, enable easy adjustments on the fly. A single red LED blinks on every quarter note, providing a visual cue of the current tempo. 

This module is ideal for a variety of applications, from programming complex drum patterns to generating evolving rhythms in generative music setups and controlling other sequencers in your patch.
