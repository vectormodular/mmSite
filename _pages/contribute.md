**Help Me Innovate!**    
My goal is to develop innovative modules for the modular community and one day bring them to life as hardware. Your contribution fuels creativity and growth in modular synthesis. 
<br>  
**Why Donate?**  
Every donation helps cover the time and resources needed to create new modules, ensuring I can continue to push the boundaries of sound and design. Together, we can transform ideas into reality. 
<br>  
**Thank You!**   
Your support means the world to me. Join me on this exciting journey!
